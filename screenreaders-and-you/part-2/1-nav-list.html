      <a> tags inside it. however, it can still be a bad experience depending on
      various factors.

      <p>
        You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
        whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
        mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
        Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
        desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.

      it's best to make an explicit list for things like this, so the user doesn't

      you're just providing a series of links.
