<!--

  this is a pretty common issue; here we have two elements
  with intersecting IDs. voiceover gets very confused by this,
  and ultimately winds up reading "this is a paragraph tag"
  when the input has focus. that's because the screenreader,
  expecting IDs to be unique, simply stops after the first one.

  in this case that's erroneous, because obviously i want to label
  the input with a label tag.

  the fix is either of:

  1. find the duplicate id and remove it
     (i.e. make the IDs truly unique; ensure the SR finds
     the right element the first time)

  2. scope your label IDs to the component and use case
     (e.g. aria-labelledby='user-name-input')

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p id='contentkasdfhasui '>this is a paragraph tag.</p>

    <label id='content'>this is an actual label.</label>
    <input type='text' aria-labelledby='content'>
  </body>
</html>
