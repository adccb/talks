  the WAI distinguishes between two broad classes of image.

  1. [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/]
  *informational* images are load-bearing; the information they
  present is crucial to the user's understanding of a page, and
  may include things like:
  - iconography, especially icons used to do things like list
    social media platforms, contact information, file formats, etc
  - logos of partners/customers/clients intended to publicly
    acknowledge a relationship
  - infographics, flow charts and other iconography intended
    to illustrate a process or action

  2. [https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/]
  *decorative* images contribute little or nothing to the semantic
  meaning of the page. this class of images may include images
  like:
  - purely decorative ("eye candy") images
  - images whose meaning is already conveyed by surrounding text
  - images used to set a tone, e.g. smiling families, people
    enjoying amusement park attractions, women laughing at salad

  when adding a new image, you should determine which kind of image
  you mean to add; if a sighted user would get some useful information
  from the image, distill that into a few words for the image's alt
  text. if, however, the image is fully superfluous for even sighted
  users' experience, consider leaving an empty alt attribute.

  it's important to remember that you need to specify the alt attribute
  regardless!

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <div>
    <!-- decorative image; no alt text -->
    <img src='https://placekitten.com/200/200/' alt='' />

    <!-- presentational image; alt text provided -->
    <img src='https://placekitten.com/200/200/' alt='a cute kitten' />

    <!-- even when using a figure/figcaption, same rules apply -->
    <figure>
      <!-- the image's alt text describes the image... --->
      <img src='https://placekitten.com/200/200' alt='a cute cat' />

      <!-- ...and the figcaption describes why it's important -->
      <figcaption>
        everyone loves cats!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
