        naively, we might rely on a name to tell
        the form how to process the data, and a
        placeholder to tell the user what data to
        enter. but screenreaders don't always read
        out placeholders on input elements. neither
        do they read ids or data attributes,
        unfortunately.

        name='title'

        even though it's clear from context that this
        button would submit the <form> that contains it,
        a screenreader will simply read something like
        "thumbs up, button". that communicates almost zero
        semantic value; the value it does communicate is
        implicit within the structure of the page.

        in short: just as we should explicitly draw the
        connection between form fields and their labels,
        we should draw those connections for form controls
        like buttons as well.

        most explicit is always best, if it's possible.
        this means drawing an outright connection between
        this label and this input#title. this conveys the
        page's structure in ways that are maximally useful
        to the interpreter.
      -->

        better than nothing, but can still sound weird.
        this should only be used when you don't/can't 
        know the explicit ID of the control itself.

        in lieu of descriptive button text, (e.g., if
        we really want to use an icon button rather than
        rendering a text node, we can simply give the
        entire button an aria label. assistive technologies
        will read the label alongside the tag name, so there's
        no need to tell the user they're looking at a button.
